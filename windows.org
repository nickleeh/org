How do I put my hotkeys and hotstrings into effect automatically every time I start my PC?
There is a folder in the Start Menu called Startup.  If you put a shortcut to your script in that folder, the script will launch automatically every time you start your PC. To create a shortcut:

Find the script file, select it, and press Control-C. Right-click the
Start button (typically at the lower left corner of the screen) and
choose "Explore All Users". Navigate to the Startup folder inside the
Programs folder. From the menu bar, choose Edit -> Paste Shortcut. The
shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.
